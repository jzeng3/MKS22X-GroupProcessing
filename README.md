# MKS22X-GroupProcessing

## Contributions

### Program Updates

One of our group members was absent for two lab periods due to AP testing, so we did not work a lot with pair programming during class. We communicated over Messenger and generally split class changes according to our roles at the beginning of the group processing lab, with Timothy updating the Rock and LivingRock classes (move and display) and Jamie updating the Ball and BallA, BallB subclasses, as well as the Collideable interface and isTouching method in Rock. Setup and draw were modified to test for Ball subclasses and colliding objects.  


### Roles

Rock (display) and LivingRock (move) - Timothy Stansberry <br />

Ball (display and move, isTouching), BallA, BallB - Jamie Zeng <br />
